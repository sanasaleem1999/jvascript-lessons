00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
Welcome to this course on JavaScript Harmony.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:11.419
Oh, don't you mean ES6? It says right here.

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:14.522
Oh, right. Sorry. Thanks Richard.

00:00:14.522 --> 00:00:18.593
Welcome to this course on ES6.

00:00:18.593 --> 00:00:18.629
Wait, wait. Sorry. It's changed again it's now ES2015.

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:19.649
What? Again? Really? You know what, welcome to this course on the future of

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:21.570
JavaScript. I am James Parkes.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.089
And I am Richard Kalehoff.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.978
We will be your instructors for this course.

00:00:24.978 --> 00:00:28.789
Technically, Harmony ES6 and ES2015,

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.434
they're all different names for virtually the same thing.

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:33.420
The important thing is that these names represent

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.745
the biggest update to the JavaScript programming language today.

00:00:36.744 --> 00:00:40.229
Fast forward from 1995 to today and JavaScript has

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:44.359
undergone a renaissance of sorts by making some much needed improvements to the language.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.012
And with these improvements come a whole new batch of keywords,

00:00:48.012 --> 00:00:49.289
ways of writing functions,

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.494
asynchronous goodies and so much more.

00:00:51.494 --> 00:00:53.339
In this course, we will explore the additions to

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.070
the JavaScript programming language so you can write faster,

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.530
cleaner, and more efficient code.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.480
In this first lesson, we will start by outlining

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.050
changes and additions to the JavaScript Syntax.

00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:06.689
In lesson two, we will investigate updates to JavaScript Functions.

00:01:06.688 --> 00:01:09.868
In lesson three, we will cover new ES6 Built-ins.

00:01:09.868 --> 00:01:12.629
And in lesson four, we will wrap things up by showing you how you can

00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:16.629
incorporate these latest updates into your next JavaScript project.

00:01:16.629 --> 00:01:18.920
Richard, what shall we start with first?

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.019
Well, a bunch of keywords have been added to the language.

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:22.634
So, let's start with one of those.

00:01:22.635 --> 00:01:25.779
Let us take a look at let in context.

00:01:25.778 --> 00:01:26.750
Yeah, that sounds good.
