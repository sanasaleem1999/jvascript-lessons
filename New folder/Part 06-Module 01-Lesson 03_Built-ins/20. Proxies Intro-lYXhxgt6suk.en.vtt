Let's switch gears for a moment to talk about proxies.

00:00:03.185 --> 00:00:05.128
The dictionary defines a proxy as...

00:00:05.128 --> 00:00:07.584
Hey, I need to give this to Richard.

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:09.740
He's kind of busy right now.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.345
Well, okay. So, can you sign that, please?

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:15.800
Yeah, sure.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.030
Here we go.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.031
Thank you.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.204
Yeah. So the dictionary defines a proxy as something that represents someone else.

00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:25.494
In ES6...

00:00:25.495 --> 00:00:27.940
Hey, can I talk to Richard for a second?

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.700
Yeah, hold on.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.701
Cool.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.869
Okay.

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:36.829
He said he could be back in like five minutes.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:37.640
Okay, yeah.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.990
Okay. Where was I?

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.130
Oh, right.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.240
Doing ES6 are JavaScript proxies.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.000
A JavaScript proxy will let one object stand in for

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.670
another object to handle all the interactions for that other object.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.565
The proxy can handle requests directly,

00:00:52.564 --> 00:00:54.859
pass data back and forth to the target object,

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:56.740
and a whole bunch of other things.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.270
Let's look at how you can create a proxy in JavaScript.
