Nice work completing lesson three.

00:00:02.484 --> 00:00:06.125
At this point you've seen almost everything there is to see in ES6.

00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:08.199
But we still have one more lesson.

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:11.519
You'd think that with all the advancements to Javascript that you'd be able

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.015
to start using every new feature in ES6, right now.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.250
But that's not really the case.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.859
Sometimes there are situations where browsers haven't

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.888
quite caught up to the latest and greatest features in Javascript.

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:27.600
In Lesson 4 you'll see how in spite of this you can still write ES6 code that

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.570
is future proof for when browsers catch

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.115
up but will still work for browsers that aren't quite up to snuff.

00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's put what you've learned to good use in the next lesson.
