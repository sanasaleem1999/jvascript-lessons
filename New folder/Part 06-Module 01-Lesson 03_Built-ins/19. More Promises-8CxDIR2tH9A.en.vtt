Promises are an incredibly powerful addition to the language,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.980
and a ton of both existing and future changes make use of them.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.375
So being able to work with and write JavaScript promises is vital.

00:00:10.375 --> 00:00:12.060
They're so important, we've actually created

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.470
a standalone course dedicated to just JavaScript Promises.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.910
Hang on a second. Hey Cameron.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.498
Hey Richard. It's good to see you.

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:22.439
We were talking about JavaScript Promises and we told

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.267
them about our dedicated course on JavaScript Promises,

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:28.184
and we thought, did you want to talk about that a little bit?

00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:32.295
I made a course on Promises – they're awesome – and you should go take it.

00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:36.465
And the reason is is that Promises make it so much easier to do asynchronous code.

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:39.840
With Promises, your code's going to be easier to read, easier to write,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.370
and most importantly as you all know,

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:43.609
it's gonna be a lot easier to debug.

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:44.789
And while you're working on this class,

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.259
you'll be also building an app called the Exoplanet Explore.

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:50.579
This is a really cool app because it helps people learn about

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.994
planets around other stars in our galaxy, real planets.

00:00:53.994 --> 00:00:56.309
So it's really amazing and it's really fun and you

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.963
should definitely check out the course if you want to master Promises.

00:00:58.963 --> 00:01:01.000
You'll find a link to the course below.
