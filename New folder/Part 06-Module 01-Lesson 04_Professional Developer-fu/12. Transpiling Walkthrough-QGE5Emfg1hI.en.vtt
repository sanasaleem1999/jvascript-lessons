00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
The projects package.json file lists all

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:06.165
of the NPM packages that this project depends on.

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:09.269
This project depends on the babel-cli and

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.234
the es2015 preset that is a collection of all ES6 plugins.

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:17.160
So these are the plugins that will be downloaded and installed.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.170
Once they're installed, we need to tell

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.085
the babel-cli which plugins it should use to do the transpiling.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:28.804
The cli will check the bbel rc file for which plugins and presets to use.

00:00:28.804 --> 00:00:32.399
So the package.json file lists what should be installed and

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.140
the babel rc file tells babel which plugins to use when it does it's transpiling.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.329
Now that babel knows to use this preset,

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.684
we need to tell to actually transpile the code.

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:44.340
To do that we've added a build script that will tell

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.400
babel to take the files in the ES6 directory,

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.399
transpile them using that ES2015 preset

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.000
and then put the transformed code in the ES5 directory.
