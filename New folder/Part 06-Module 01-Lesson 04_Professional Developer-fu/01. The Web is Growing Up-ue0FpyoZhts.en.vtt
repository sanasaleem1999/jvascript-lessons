Welcome back! In this lesson,

00:00:02.495 --> 00:00:04.676
we will prepare you for deploying ES6

00:00:04.676 --> 00:00:07.041
in the ever changing environment that is in the Web.

00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:09.755
Basically, the web had a beginning,

00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:11.190
but it won't have an end.

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:12.679
As new technology comes out,

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.053
it won't be supported by older browsers.

00:00:15.053 --> 00:00:18.568
And this can make it challenging when you want to work with ES6.

00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:20.528
How are you supposed to write ES6,

00:00:20.527 --> 00:00:22.459
but still support older browsers?

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.310
Well, let's take a look.
