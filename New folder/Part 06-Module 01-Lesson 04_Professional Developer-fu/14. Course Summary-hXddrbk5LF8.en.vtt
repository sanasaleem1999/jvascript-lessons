00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
Congratulations! You've made it to the end of this course on ES6.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.470
You mean ES2015, right? Sure, whatever.

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:11.248
Look, you've made it to the end of this course on the future of JavaScript.

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:15.420
Before you go, let's not forget about the things you've learned during this course.

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.190
In lesson one, you learned about

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.920
the most recent syntax additions to the JavaScript language.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.225
In lesson two, you discovered

00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:25.830
new ways for writing functions and how to create JavaScript classes.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.539
In lesson three, you were exposed to the latest built-ins provided to you in ES6.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.969
And, in lesson four,

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:37.097
we wrapped it up by showing you how to incorporate ES6 into your next JavaScript project.

00:00:37.097 --> 00:00:40.140
We hope you found this course to be insightful and it will inspire

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.119
you to start using ES6 in whatever projects you work on in the future.
