00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Remember that a polyfill is used to fill a hole

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.690
in a browser that doesn't yet support the native feature.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.935
This polyfill start to check to see if the native startsWith method actually exists.

00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:14.429
Why? Because if it does exist then

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.530
we don't want to override the native version with this one.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.275
So if it doesn't exist,

00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:23.754
then the browser running this polyfill will then run all of this code.

00:00:23.754 --> 00:00:27.649
This adds a new method to Strings.prototype object.

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.479
The function defaults to the position indicated by

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.424
the second argument that's passed in or it'll be the first character of the string.

00:00:35.424 --> 00:00:38.214
Then it just returns true or false.

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:42.780
If the string that's passed in is the same as the string that we're looking at.
