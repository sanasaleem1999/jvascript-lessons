00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.014
You're a pro at JavaScript,

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:05.749
but that does not mean you can just "kick back and coast."

00:00:05.748 --> 00:00:09.439
These new additions in ES6 have brought a major change to the language.

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:11.099
You can not just ignore them in bank on

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.605
your existing knowledge of a now behind-the-times technology.

00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:16.859
You have got to get up, dig into the features,

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.679
read the specification, follow some tutorials,

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.015
maybe even write some of your own.

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:25.440
The Web is an evolving platform and you need to evolve with it.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.929
Imagine being stuck on old horrible equipment when

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.149
there are newer nicer tools available for you to use.

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.479
You now know how JavaScript language improvements are

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:36.344
made and where to find browser support for them.

00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:38.350
You have got the tools. You just need to use them.
