00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.649
You ready Richard?

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:03.270
Almost. Hang on.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.395
As you can see this wall is in bad shape.

00:00:06.395 --> 00:00:08.560
Richard is getting something to fill it in.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.110
Still looking for it.

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.138
There's a little bit of this wall that's missing

00:00:12.138 --> 00:00:14.474
and once Richard finds what he's looking for,

00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:16.259
we're going to fill the hole so you won't be able to

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.440
tell anything is wrong with it or missing.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.818
Found it.

00:00:19.818 --> 00:00:21.589
In the United States,

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:23.129
we call this Spackling,

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:25.375
and it's just a common paste to fill holes

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:27.875
in cracks to smooth out any defects in the wall.

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:29.155
In the United Kingdom,

00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:32.143
a popular brand name for this is Polyfilla.

00:00:32.143 --> 00:00:37.140
Using Spackling or Polyfilla it's impossible to tell that there's a hole in this wall.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.929
For the web, a polyfill does the same thing.

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:42.420
There's some bit of functionality that might be

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.910
missing in a browser that needs to get filled.

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:48.119
A polyfill is a JavaScript file that patches a hole

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:52.000
by replicating some native feature for browsers that don't have it yet.
