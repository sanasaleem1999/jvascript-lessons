00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
Classes in JavaScript, what do you think about them?

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.939
I think they're great. I mean they're a bit confusing if

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.359
you think about how classes work in other languages,

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:10.349
but the general concept is all the same.

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.359
Do you want to elaborate a bit on that?

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:14.219
Well in other languages,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.940
we use classes to create objects and provide inheritance.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.798
But you're saying that JavaScript isn't like that?

00:00:20.798 --> 00:00:23.278
Not exactly. In JavaScript,

00:00:23.278 --> 00:00:25.410
we use functions to create objects.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.844
So when we create a new dessert like this,

00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:31.070
dessert is just a regular function.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.125
Oh, right. And being able to inherit data

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:37.530
and functionality in JavaScript happens through prototypal inheritance.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.359
Exactly. Just because ECMAScript has provided us with new keywords like class,

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:47.320
super, and extends, it doesn't mean the entire way the language works has changed.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.405
So JavaScript still uses functions and prototypal inheritance under the hood.

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:54.630
We just have a new cleaner way to write the same functionality, right?

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.925
You got it. But keep in mind,

00:00:56.924 --> 00:01:00.265
that the underlying functionality of the language hasn't changed.

00:01:00.265 --> 00:01:04.549
Okay. So JavaScript is not a class-based language.

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.155
It uses functions to create objects and links objects together by prototypal inheritance.

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:10.920
Yep. JavaScript classes are

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.730
just a thin mirage over regular functions and prototypal inheritance.
